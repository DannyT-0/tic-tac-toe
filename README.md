Tic Tac ToeProject start 1/31/21

Project allows for tic tac toe to be played on the browser. Game does not start until players enter a name for each player and press start button. Reset button resets the game console. Some bugs to still work out. If O is clicked twice, it changes to X. Will put AI in later as well. The Tie conditions might not be perfect either?
